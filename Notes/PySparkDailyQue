program and the Spark cluster (or local Spark instance), and it enables your program to access Spark's capabilities like:
Distributed data processing
Creating RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)
Reading data from files
Setting configurations
Running parallel operations

7.What are RDDs in PySpark?
-->
RDD stands for Resilient Distributed Dataset.
In PySpark, RDDs are the fundamental data structure used for fault-tolerant, distributed data processing.
It i immutable means once it is creted can not be changed.
Any transformation on RDD results in new RDD

8.what is dataframe in pyspark?
-->
A DataFrame in PySpark is a distributed collection of data organized into named columns, similar to a table in a relational 
database or a Pandas DataFrame in Python — but designed to handle big data efficiently using Spark's distributed processing 
engine

9.what is dataset in pyspark?
-->
In Apache Spark, a Dataset is a strongly-typed, distributed collection of data similar to a DataFrame, but with type safety 
and object-oriented programming features.
However, in PySpark, Dataset is not directly available because Python is a dynamically typed language and does not support 
compile-time type checking like Scala or Java.

| **Dataset**   | **Scala, Java only** | Typed version of DataFrame + RDD (not in PySpark) |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
day2.
1.Why do we use PySpark SparkFiles?
-->
SparkFiles in PySpark is a utility that helps you distribute external files (like .txt, .csv, .json, .jar, .zip, or even Python scripts) across all nodes in a Spark cluster, so that every executor can access those files during processing

2.What are PySpark serializers?
-->
PySpark serializers are mechanisms used to convert Python objects into a format that can be efficiently sent over the network or stored, and then reconstructed (deserialized) on another machine in the Spark cluster.

3.What are PySpark deserializers?
-->
PySpark Deserializers are the counterpart of serializers — they convert the serialized (byte stream) data back into usable Python objects after data is transmitted between the nodes in a Spark cluster.

🔁 Summary:
Term	        Purpose
Serializer	    Converts Python object → Byte stream
Deserializer	Converts Byte stream → Python object
Use in Spark	Enables efficient data transfer & distributed processing

4.what is meant by Transformation?
-->
In PySpark, a transformation is an operation on an RDD or DataFrame that defines a new dataset from an existing one without immediately executing it.

5.what is action in pyspark?
-->
In PySpark, an Action is an operation that triggers the execution of all previously defined Transformations on an RDD or DataFrame and returns a result to the driver program or writes output to storage.

6.Does PySpark provide a machine learning API?
-->
 Yes, PySpark provides a powerful Machine Learning API through its module calle
pyspark.ml – the DataFrame-based Machine Learning API

7.What are the different cluster manager types supported by PySpark?

4.What are the types of PySpark’s shared variables and why are they useful?(write in brief)
--> There are two types of shared variables :
1.Broadcast variables
2.Accumulators

 1. Broadcast Variables
Purpose: Share read-only data (e.g., large lookup tables) across all worker nodes without sending it repeatedly with each task.
Usefulness:
Reduces network I/O.
Improves performance for repetitive reads of the same data.
Example Use Case: Joining a large static lookup table with another dataset.

 2. Accumulators
Purpose: Used to aggregate information across tasks, like counters or sums.
Usefulness:
Helps in tracking metrics, debugging, or logging.
Only the driver can read the value; workers can only add to it.
Example Use Case: Counting the number of invalid records or errors during processing.


5.What is PySpark UDF?
-->
1.It is user Defined Function written in python
2.Use to apply non-native logic to DataFrame columns

6.What is PySpark Architecture?(writen and learn it)
-->
Apache Spark follows a master-slave architecture consiting of 3 main component : 
Driver,Cluster Manager, and Executors

1.Driver Program 
- Central co-ordinator of Spark application.
- Runs a main function of spark code.
- Contains :
    1.SparkSession/SparkContext : entry point for Spark function
    2.DAGScheduler : breaks jobs into stages
    3.TaskSchedular : sends task to executor
- Responsibility :
    1.Converts user code into DAG
    2.Coordinates the execution of tasks
    3.Tracks progress and faults

2.Cluster Manager
- Allocates resources(CPU core,memory) across application
- Types :
    1.Standalone(default spark cluster)
    2.YARN (Hadoop)
    3.Mesos
    4.Kubernetes
- Responsibility : 
    1.Launches executors on worker nodes based on requests from the driver.

3.Executor : 
- Worker processes launched on cluster nodes.
- Each spark application has its own set of executors
- Responsibility : 
    1.Executes tasks assigned by the driver
    2.Stores data in memory(RDD caching)
    3.Sends results back to driver

4.Tasks, Jobs, and stages
1.Jobs  - Triggered by an action(like .collect() or .save())
2.Stage - A set of tasks with no shuffle dependencies
3.Task  - The smallest unit of execution 


7.What PySpark DAGScheduler?
-->
The DAGScheduler in PySpark is a core component of the Spark execution engine that is responsible for building and scheduling 
execution stages as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of stages and tasks.

4.Perform action or apply business logic
5.Write output(HDFS,S#,local,Database,etc)
6.Stop sparksession


4.groupby in pyspark?
-->
In PySpark, groupBy() is used to group rows based on the values of one or more columns — similar to SQL's GROUP BY. It is 
typically followed by an aggregation function like count(), sum(), avg(), etc.

from pyspark.sql.functions import sum, avg

df.groupBy("region").agg(
    sum("sales").alias("total_sales"),
    avg("sales").alias("avg_sales")
).show()

5.windowing function in pyspark?(write theory and code also)
-->
Window function apply on group of rows (like frame,partition) and return a single value for every input row.
Ex : row_number(),rank(),dense_rank(),lag(),lead()

# row_number() example
from pyspark.sql.window import Window
from pyspark.sql.functions import row_number
windowSpec  = Window.partitionBy("department").orderBy("salary")

df.withColumn("row_number",row_number().over(windowSpec)).show(truncate=False)

6.what is master,builder in sparksession?
-->
master : Defines where the spark application runs 
Ex :  local,local[*],yarn,"spark://<host>:<port>"
builder : Starts the configuration of the sparksession
SparkSession.builder.appName("SalesApp").getOrCreate()

7.How can we create DataFrames in PySpark?
1. From a Python List (or List of Tuples)
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("CreateDF").getOrCreate()
data = [("Alice", 25), ("Bob", 30), ("Cathy", 28)]
columns = ["Name", "Age"]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)
df.show()

2. From a List of Dictionaries
data = [{"Name": "David", "Age": 22}, {"Name": "Eva", "Age": 31}]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data)
df.show()

3. From a CSV File
df = spark.read.csv("data/employees.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
df.show()

4. From JSON, Parquet, or other formats
# JSON
df = spark.read.json("data/people.json")
# Parquet
df = spark.read.parquet("data/sales.parquet")

5. From RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)
rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize([("John", 40), ("Sara", 35)])
df = rdd.toDF(["Name", "Age"])
df.show()

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

day5.
1.Is it possible to create PySpark DataFrame from external data sources?
-->
yes,pyspark support reading data from:
CSV,Json,Parque,ORC,Avro,Hive tables,etc.

2.What is PySpark SQL?
-->
It allowes to process stuctured data using SQL queries,Dataframe API, and Dataset API.
Run SQL queries on RDD and Dataframe
Can read data of various format(CSV,JSon,Parque,Hive)

Example: 
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("SQLExample").getOrCreate()
df = spark.read.csv("data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
df.createOrReplaceTempView("my_table")
result = spark.sql("SELECT name, salary FROM my_table WHERE salary > 50000")
result.show()

3.how to find 2nd higest salary in pyspark?
-->
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("SecondHighestSalary").getOrCreate()

# Example DataFrame
data = [("Alice", 50000), ("Bob", 60000), ("Cathy", 70000), ("David", 60000)]
columns = ["name", "salary"]
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, columns)

# Define window spec
windowSpec = Window.orderBy(df["salary"].desc())

# Add row number
df_with_rank = df.withColumn("rank", row_number().over(windowSpec))

# Filter for 2nd highest salary
second_highest = df_with_rank.filter(df_with_rank["rank"] == 2)
second_highest.show()


4.How can you inner join two DataFrames?
-->
To inner join two DataFrames in PySpark, use the .join() method and specify the join column(s) and join type as "inner" (which is the default).

result = df1.join(df2, on="id", how="inner")


5.joins in pyspark and write all query of all joins in pyspark?
-->
1. Inner Join
Returns rows with matching keys in both DataFrames.
result = df1.join(df2, on="id", how="inner")

2. Left Outer Join (Left Join)
Returns all rows from the left DataFrame and matching rows from the right DataFrame.
result = df1.join(df2, on="id", how="left")

3. Right Outer Join (Right Join)
Returns all rows from the right DataFrame and matching rows from the left DataFrame.
result = df1.join(df2, on="id", how="right")


4. Full Outer Join
Returns all rows when there is a match in either left or right DataFrame.
result = df1.join(df2, on="id", how="outer")

5. Left Semi Join
Returns only rows from the left DataFrame where there is a match in the right DataFrame.
result = df1.join(df2, on="id", how="left_semi")

6. Left Anti Join
Returns only rows from the left DataFrame where there is no match in the right DataFrame.
result = df1.join(df2, on="id", how="left_anti")

| Join Type   | How Parameter  | Description                                 |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Inner Join  | "inner"        | Only matching rows                          |
| Left Join   | "left"         | All left + matching right                   |
| Right Join  | "right"        | All right + matching left                   |

| Left Semi   | "left_semi"    | Only left rows with match in right          |
| Left Anti   | "left_anti"    | Only left rows with NO match in right       |

6.What do you understand by Pyspark Streaming? 
-->
1.Spark streaming is a scalable fault-tolerant streaming procress that support both batch and streaming workloads.
2.It process realtime data from various sources like kafka,Flume and AMAZON Kinesis.

7.What would happen if we lose RDD partitions due to the failure of the worker node?
-->
SPARK regenerates the RDD again by the help of linage. Basically until you are calling any action, spark don't start processing

8.what are the types in transformation?(that is narrow and wide)
-->
Narrow : 
1.Each output partition depends on single input partition.
2.No data shuffle between nodes
3.Localize computation within partition
4.Faster execution
Ex : map(), filter(), flatMap()

Wide :
1.it requires data from multiple partitiotons to createa single output partition
2.Data shuffle between node.
3.Generally slower due to data dsitribution.
Ex : groupByKey(),reduceByKey(),join()

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
day6
1.In-memory computation in pyspark?
--> 
Data kept in RAM instead of some slow disk
Processed in parallel
Key abstraction of spark is RDD and the RDD are cached using the cache() and persist() method.

2. What is PySpark Storage Level?
-->
In PySpark, a Storage Level defines how and where an RDD or DataFrame's partitions are stored in the cluster after they are computed. It gives you fine-grained control over the trade-offs between performance (speed of access), memory usage, and fault tolerance.
When you use the persist() method (or cache(), which is a shorthand for a specific storage level), you tell Spark to keep the data around for future use. The StorageLevel object specifies the exact strategy for this persistence.
Most common PySpark Storage Levels : 
1.StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY
2.StorageLevel.MEMORY_ONLY_SER
3.StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK
4.StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK_SER
5.StorageLevel.DISK_ONLY


3.When do you use Spark Stage info?
-->
When we need for shuffling data between transformation we use Spark stage.It break down Spark job into smaller more 
manageable units of work.
Key reason : 
1.Shuffling data
2.Parallelism
3.Job decomposition
4.Scheduling
5.Monitoring

4. Can we use PySpark in the small data set?
-->
Yes, PySpark can be used with small datasets, but it is generally not recommended as its primary advantage lies in handling large, distributed datasets.

5. What is PySpark Partition?
-->
In PySpark, data partitioning refers to the process of dividing a large dataset into smaller chunks or partitions, which can be processed concurrently.
Methods :
1.Hash Partitioning
2.Range Partitioning
3.Using partitionBy

6. Tell me the different cluster manager types in PySpark.
1.Standalone :
Pros: Easy to set up, no additional dependencies, suitable for small clusters.
Cons: Limited scalability, basic resource management.

2.Hadoop YARN
Pros: Robust resource management, integration with Hadoop ecosystem, high scalability.
Cons: Complex setup, additional overhead from Hadoop.

3. Apache Mesos:
Pros: High scalability, supports multiple frameworks, efficient resource management.
Cons: Complex setup, requires additional components.

4. Kubernetes:
Pros: Advanced resource management, containerization, high scalability, fault tolerance.
Cons: Complex setup, requires containerization knowledge.


7.how many partitions can you make in PySpark?
-->
By default, Dataframe shuffle operations create 200 partitions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

day 7
1.Why are Partitions immutable in PySpark?
-->
To ensure data partition cannot be altered once created.
Understanding and leveraging this immutability can help developers write more efficient and reliable PySpark applications, capable of handling the complexities of big data with ease.

2.what is repartitions in pyspark?
-->
pyspark.sql.DataFrame.repartition() method is used to increase or decrease the RDD/DataFrame partitions by number of partitions or by single column name or multiple column names. This function takes 2 parameters; numPartitions and *cols, when one is specified the other is optional. repartition() is a wider transformation that involves shuffling of the data hence, it is considered an expensive operation

3.what is cache?
-->
Pyspark cache() method is used to cache the intermediate results of the transformation so that other transformation runs on top of cached will perform faster.
cache() is a lazy evaluation in PySpark meaning it will not cache the results until you call the action operation.

4.what is persisting? types?
--> 
It allowes to store the results of an RDD or DataFrame computation in memory, on disk, or a combination of both, across the nodes of your Spark cluster
Types :
Diffrent storageLevel.
    
5.what is coalesce?
-->
transformation operation used to reduce the number of partitions in an RDD or DataFrame

6.difference between coalesce and partitions?
-->

| #      | Technique                                 | Description                                                                               |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣    | **Persist / Cache**                       | Avoid re-computation by storing intermediate results in memory.                           |
| 2️⃣    | **Partitioning**                          | Proper partitioning helps distribute data evenly across nodes.                            |
| 3️⃣    | **Broadcast Variables**                   | Use `broadcast()` to send small lookup tables to all executors, avoiding large shuffles.  |
| 4️⃣    | **Avoid Shuffles**                        | Reduce operations like `groupByKey()` or `join` on skewed keys to minimize data movement. |
| 5️⃣    | **Use Columnar Formats (Parquet/ORC)**    | Read only needed columns, improving I/O efficiency.                                       |
| 6️⃣    | **Pushdown Filters / Predicate Pushdown** | Apply filters early so only required data is read from source.                            |
| 7️⃣    | **Coalesce vs Repartition**               | Use `coalesce()` for reducing partitions efficiently (no full shuffle).                   |
| 8️⃣    | **Avoid UDFs if possible**                | Use built-in Spark functions instead of Python UDFs for better performance.               |
| 9️⃣    | **Use Catalyst Optimizer**                | Spark's internal query optimizer automatically rewrites queries for performance.          |
| 🔟     | **Tungsten Execution Engine**             | Spark’s backend optimizes memory and CPU usage via code generation.                       |
| 1️⃣1️⃣ | **Use `filter()` before `join()`**        | Reduce data volume before joins to avoid large shuffles.                                  |
| 1️⃣2️⃣ | **Skew Handling**                         | Use techniques like salting when join keys are skewed.                                    |

1.What are the key advantages of PySpark RDD?
-->
Adv : 
1.In memory processing
2.immutability
3.Fault tolerant
4.Lazy Evolution
5.Partitioning

2.what is lazy Lazy Evolution/transformation?
-->
When transformation applies on RDD, DataFrame or Dataset then it is not executed immediately.Sparks build a logical execution plan(DAG) and differs computation until an action id triggered.

3.what is Fault Tolerance?
-->
It is the system ability to continue operating and recovering from failures without losing data or requiring a complete restart of the computation.

4.What do you understand by Spark driver?
-->
1.It is core component to communicate between spark application.
2.It manages the execution flow of spark application.
3.Responsible for tasks on executor, scheduling work, etc.
4.Process the main function


5.What are the main functions of Spark core?
-->
1.Task scheduling
2.Memory management
3.Falut tolerance
4.RDD API
5.I/O support
6.Cluster management
7.logging and Monitoring

6.What do you understand by RDD Lineage?
-->
— RDD lineage refers to the logical sequence of transformations that were applied to create an RDD from its source data or other RDDs.
— It represents the history of how data is derived and transformed, step by step, from its original form to the current RDD.
— RDD lineage is used for fault tolerance. When a node fails, Spark can reconstruct lost partitions by reapplying the transformations specified in the lineage.
— Lineage information is recorded for each RDD, which enables Spark to recompute lost data efficiently without needing to store the entire dataset.
— RDD lineage ensures that lost data can be recovered by re-executing only the necessary transformations.

7.What are the main file systems supported by Spark?
-->
1.HDFS
2.Amazon S3
3.Local

8.Explain the use of StructType and StructField classes in PySpark with examples.
-->
StructType: Represents the entire schema as a structure of fields (like a table with columns).
StructField: Represents a single column in the schema (name, data type, nullable).

`from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, IntegerType

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("SchemaExample").getOrCreate()

# Define the schema
data_schema = StructType([
    StructField("first_name", StringType(), True),
    StructField("last_name", StringType(), True),
    StructField("age", IntegerType(), True)
])

# Sample data
data = [
    ("Alice", "Smith", 30),
    ("Bob", "Johnson", 25),
    ("Charlie", None, 35) # Example with a null value
]

# Create a DataFrame with the specified schema
df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=data_schema)

df.printSchema()
df.show()

spark.stop()`
